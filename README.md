**GraphQL Inspector** outputs a list of changes between two GraphQL schemas. Every change is
precisely explained and marked as breaking, non-breaking or dangerous. It helps you validate
documents and fragments against a schema and even find similar or duplicated types.

> You may like [GraphQL Hive](https://graphql-hive.com) as well!
>
> It's an open-source performance monitoring tool and schema registry for GraphQL.
>
> GraphQL Hive is currently available as a hosted service but it offers self-hosting as well.
