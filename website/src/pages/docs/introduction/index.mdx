# What is GraphQL Inspector?

GraphQL Inspector is a set of tools to help you better maintain and improve GraphQL API as well as
GraphQL consumers.

GraphQL Inspector outputs a list of changes between two GraphQL schemas. Every change is precisely
explained and marked as breaking, non-breaking or dangerous. It will help you validate documents and
fragments against a schema and even find similar or duplicated types.

**Use GraphQL Inspector however you like:**

- **Command Line Tool**
- [**GitHub Application**](/docs/products/github)
- [**GitHub Action**](/docs/products/action)
- **Programmatic API**

The way GraphQL Inspector is built enables you to use everything through a CLI or each feature
separately using one of many available packages. There's also a GitHub Application that you can
install and use within seconds. If you're a fan of GitHub Actions, we got you covered too.

## GitHub Application and Action

Use our Application and get everything up and running within a few seconds. If you prefer, you can
have your own self-hosted GraphQL Inspector service or deploy it with Docker. You can also simply
use our GitHub Action.
